<p>
    Thank you for your participation up to this point.<br><br>
    In the next task, you will determine how you would like to divide certain amounts of money between yourself and
    another person. The other person is another study participant unknown to you and with whom you have not interacted before. You will remain mutually anonymous.
    All your decisions are completely confidential. <br><br>

    There is a sending and a receiving person (here called <b>“other person”</b>). You will make a total of 15 decisions
    in the role of the sending person. However, the sender will decide on the distribution of monetary units for
    themselves and the receiver. Your task is therefore to indicate which distribution you prefer for each of the
    following 15 questions. <br><br>

    Your decisions will generate money for both you and the other person. In the example below, one person has decided
    to divide the money so that they themselves receive 45 monetary units, while the anonymous other person receives 50
    monetary units. One monetary unit corresponds to one euro cent (€0.01). Thus, in the example below, the person
    allocates 45 cents to themselves and 50 cents to the other person.<br><br>

    There are no right or wrong answers to this task, it is all about your personal preferences. Once you have made your
    decision, <b>select the appropriate option.</b> You can only mark <b>one item per question.</b><br><br>

    If this task is selected for your payout for this part of the study, your payout will be calculated according to the
    following principle: Exactly one of the 15 decisions will be randomly selected. With a 50 % chance
    you will receive payout as the sender. With another 50 % chance you will receive the corresponding payout as the
    receiving person. Each of the following 15 decisions can therefore potentially determine how much
    money you receive for your participation.
