<p> Thank you for your participation up to this point.<br><br>

    The next task involves two people: You and someone else. Imagine that the other person is someone you haven't met
    before and will not knowingly meet again in the future (because you will not get to know or see each other in
    person).<br><br>

    Also imagine that you both get to choose one of the objects we will show you in a minute. There are only a few
    objects left. <b>Once taken, these will not be replaced. You always get to choose first.</b><br><br>

    <b>To summarize:</b> You and someone else can each choose one among the objects shown on the screen. It is important
    to remember that you always choose first. The chosen object is not going to be replaced.<br><br>

    First, you will see two examples.

    Please click on "Next" to start the examples.
