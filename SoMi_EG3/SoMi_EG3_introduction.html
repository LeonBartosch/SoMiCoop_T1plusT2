<p> Thank you for your participation up to this point.<br><br>

    Imagine that from now on, the situation slightly changes.<br><br>

    You will now receive feedback from the second chooser about your choice. They will indicate with a smiley how they
    perceive your choice.<br><br>

    <b>Reminder:</b> There are two of you and <b>you always choose first.</b> The other person chooses after you. Using
    smileys, they will tell you how they rate your behavior after your decision.

    Please click on “Next” to start the task.
