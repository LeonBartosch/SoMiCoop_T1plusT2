   <p> <h2> Purpose of this study </h2> </p>
    In this study, we investigate decision-making in social interactions.

    <p> <h2> Participation </h2> </p>
<p> Participation in this study is completely voluntary. This means that you can end your participation at any time and
    without any explanation. This will not have any detrimental consequences for you. </p>
   <p> If you decide to withdraw, you will receive a payment in proportion to your investment. </p>

   <p> In order to participate, you must meet all of the following inclusion criteria:
    Adults <b> over the age of 18 years </b>. </p>

   <p> If you cannot participate due to any of these criteria, you do not need to disclose which one. Simply leave the
       experiment by closing this page. </p>

    <p> <h2> Procedure </h2> </p>
<p> This study is divided into <b> two parts </b>. This is the first part; it is expected to take 20 minutes to
    complete. You have already received a registration confirmation for the second part by e-mail. </p>

<p> Please complete this study seriously and in full. Please allow yourself sufficient time and try to avoid
    distractions. Please note that for technical reasons <b> you cannot participate in this study from mobile devices
    </b> (i.e. smartphone or tablet), but only via laptop or PC. Otherwise, there will be problems displaying the study
    content! </p>

  <p> <h3> Benefits and risks </h3> </p>
    There are no known risks associated with participation in this study. All stimuli and procedures are harmless.

    <p> <h3> Compensation </h3> </p>

    <p> For the compensation of this study, the sum of the variable amounts from both parts of the study is calculated.
        The total compensation variables between € xx and € yy. The respective amounts depend on your decisions and the
        decisions of the other participants. You will be informed in detail about the payout options in the relevant
        tasks. <b>You will only be paid for this study if you participate fully in both parts.</b> Otherwise, you will
        receive a pro-rata amount of €2. Your payment will be transferred to you via <b><u>bank transfer</u></b> after
        the second part. We will ask you for the corresponding details (your IBAN etc.) at the end of this study in a
        <b>separate survey after the second part</b> of the study. Thereby, we will be unable to match the scientific
        data with your personal data.
    </p>

   <p> <h2> Confidentiality and privacy </h2> </p>
<p> All your data will be handled with strict confidentiality. During the study, decision and demographic data are
    collected through answers to the questions and tasks. The research data collected is then scientifically analyzed in
    aggregated form. The resulting findings are used for the preparation of scientific research papers and presentations.
</p>

    <p> When participating in the study, the researcher may ask you for your photo ID so that we can confirm you have
        not participated previously. The researcher will only perform a visual check, and your ID will not be stored or
        copied in any way. </p>

    <p> <h3> How do we protect your privacy? </h3> </p>
<p> To protect your privacy, your data will be stored, processed and published in a coded manner. This means we
    associate your data with a code rather than your personally-identifiable information, so only only the researcher(s)
    in charge will be able to link the data to you. We save the key to the code in a physically-locked or
    password-protected location, accessible only to the researcher(s) in charge. </p>

<p> We store your data for 10 years. For the sake of transparency and open science, your anonymous/de-identified data
    will be made available to other interested researchers via accessible data repositories. </p>

   <p> <h3> Can you withdraw your consent for the use of your data? </h3> </p>
    You can take back your consent for the use, storage, and publishing of your data within two weeks after your
participation has ended.

<p> For more information on data privacy and your rights, please check the European Union’s data privacy law, known as
    the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). </p>
