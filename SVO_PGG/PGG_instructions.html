<p>In the following, You will interact with three other randomly selected study participants. You will remain anonymous,
    just as the three group members will remain anonymous to you. Each group member will receive the same instructions.
    <br><br>

    <b>Please note:</b> The payout for this decision situation is between €3 and €15 (in case this task is selected for
    your payout). The amount of your payout depends on your decisions and those of your group members.<br><br>

    Each person in your group receives a starting amount of €6 for this interaction.<br>
    You decide how much of this €6 you want to keep and how much (if any) you want to contribute to a joint group
    project. The total amount of money contributed by all group members to the joint project will be doubled and divided
    equally between the 4 group members.<br><br>

    Accordingly, each group member receives €1 for every €2 contributed to the joint project. If everyone contributes
    their entire €6 to the joint project, the money from all group members is doubled: each of them then earns €12.

    If all other group members contribute €6, but you keep your €6, you earn €15, while the others only receive €9.

    However, if you are the only one to contribute €6 and the other group members keep their €6, you only earn €3 while
    the others receive €9.<br>

    The other persons are <b>REAL</b> and will actually make a decision that will affect your payout amount (if this
    interaction is selected for your payout).<br><br>
