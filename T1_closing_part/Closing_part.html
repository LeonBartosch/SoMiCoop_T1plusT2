<p>This part assesses general individual differences (for instance self-reports on your personality) that we measure to
    investigate how they relate to individual behavioral measures that will be collected in the second part of the
    study.<br><br>

    <b>The second part of the study will take place in the laboratory</b> (SSH labs Sylvius building; Sylviusweg 72,
    2333 BE Leiden). You have already registered for an appointment here. Please note that you will receive your payment
    <b>only after having completed both parts of the study.</b> It is thus vital that you take part in the second,
    laboratory part of the study.<br>
